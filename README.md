# CG2271 Real Time Operating Systems

Real-time systems must respond quickly to inputs from the environment in order to work effectively and safely, and realtime operating systems (RTOS) are a critical part of such systems. In this course the student is exposed to basic RTOS concepts like tasks, scheduling algorithms, RTOS customisation and concurrent real-time programming. By the end of this course a student will not only understand how an RTOS is built, but will also gain practical hands-on experience in customising RTOSs and in writing real-time programs.
